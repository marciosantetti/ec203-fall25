## The government & the economy


<br>

## The government & the economy


<br>

[Expenditures]{.note} side:


<br>

- Why should the government be spending billions of dollars on aid to local [schools]{.note}, [health insurance]{.note} for the [unemployed]{.note}, and new electrical grids? 

- Why is the government the [primary provider]{.note} of goods and services such as highways and education?

- Then why the provision of goods and services such as clothing, entertainment, and property insurance is generally left to the [private]{.note} sector? 



## The government & the economy


<br>

[Revenue]{.note} side:


<br>
